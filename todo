Things to do....
[ ] add system close() message that kills tk, curses, sockets, everything.
[ ] add game ending message
[ ] add made bid message - unless you made the bid.
[ ] add modes (configuration) ... handle incoming packet
[ ] add gametypes control with manager.


Whats next
[ ] Integrate the use of names. should be more important, would make things
less confusing.
[ ] Add going "alone"
[ ] Add who made the bid message

[ ] Web interface.
[ ] rewrite/expand player_server...
[ ] ask expectations. [str vs int]
[ ] change "team" to "score"?
[ ] re-write the curses player to work like tk?
[ ] use execfile() in manager?
[ ] use filter and min for the type casting ex. trumps, ranks
[ ] use decorators for logging. caching... ?
[ ] pass score in the 'notifications'

TK problems

Coding Problems
[ ] Player  and "1?,2?,3?" - "4" logic fixed... threw a lower trump

test in playground

"Mental Mistakes"
[ ] Reread and comment ai... make sure its logical

Worthless and Cool

[ ] Learning use (results) for logged memory and improvement.
[ ] Make a self teaching euchre manual... auto generate "rules of thumb"
[ ] Teach it new styles of play 
[ ] Self modifying card "value" sheet
[ ] Self modifying code
[ ] Have it learn playing styles from humans... and mimic their style in
background trying to learn how to beat them...agressive, passive, etc.
[ ] Add color schemes for curses

[ ] Figure out why for _trick in tricks, doesnt work for the next trick
something to do with 2 * [trick()] and [trick(), trick()]
